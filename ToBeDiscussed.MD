List of things to be discussed in reunion:

- Mathematical modeling of the objectives and constraints
  - how to mathematically compute the productivity of the terrain?
  - how to mathematically compute the zproximity to inhabited zones?
  - how to mathematically compute the compacity of the terrain?
- Fitness function definition
  - Weighted sum or weighted distances?
- Generation loop termination condition
  - Nb of generations
  - Convergence area: 
    - When the area below the dominant solutions do not decrease it is means that the algorithm is no longer producing better solutions
  - Time:
    - Presentation constraint implies that the code should not takes more than 20 minutes to find an optimal solution
- Parent selection method   
  - How to choose the pair of parent solutions that will generate a child
  - By Pair taking the fitter ones?
  - The fitter ones with the worst ones?
- Reproduction method
  - How can we combine two solutions?
  - taking the first half of the first parent and combining with the second half of the second parent and vice-versa for the second child?
  - taking random elements of the first parent and random elements of the second parent?
- Mutation method
  - It should be implied to the new child generation of solutions
  - with which probability?
    - 3% 5% 25% ?
  - how will be the mutation affect the child?
    - change a single parcel?
    - adding new random parcels to the solution?
- Natural selection
  - After generating all the children, this new generation should be evaluted and only the fitter should rest.
  - How to identify the fitter solutions and eliminates the rest half?
    - sort the population in desceding order of fitness and then erase the second half?
      - is it really needed to sort the population?
      - sorting is time expensive
- When the genetic algorithm generates sufficiently good solutions, it is needed to identify the Pareto Optimal Front.
- Tasks share
